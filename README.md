# xorchive

> Hyperdimensional lockbox - Non-enumerable blob storage.

A variant implementation of [OFFS technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OFFSystem).

Files stored in this archive are mixed with witenoise,
without the `key` a file cannot be recovered, let alone proven to have been stored.
Each pad in the archive might or might not be part of multiple files.

- Sits ontop of [random-access-storage](https://github.com/random-access-storage) (works in browser + node)
- [XOR-pad encrypts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_cipher) contents (default 7 pads)
- Unknown total amount of files
- Unique key for each file
- Uses blake3 to hash pads into keys

## <a name="usage"></a> Usage

```
const raf = require('random-access-file')
const Xorchive = require('xorchive')

const xfs = new Xorchive(raf('myStuff/'), nPads = 7)

let k1 = await xfs.store(readFileSync('~/secret_evidence.md'))
const k2 = await xfs.store(readFileSync('~/README.md'))
// Each key is (32 * nPads) bytes in size

const doc = await xfs.recover(k2)

let k1 = null // secret_evidence.md is now lost forever,
// and there's no proof of it ever having been stored.
```

## API

### `new Xorchive(storage, nPads = 7, padSize = 128kB, hashSize = 32)`

Initialized a new archive.

- `nPads` number of random pads to use for chunk encryption.
- `padSize` the size of a pad. defaults to `128 << 10`
- `hashSize` blake3 hashSize


### `store(data)`

Encrypts your data as `data.length / padSize` chunks and
returns a Promise for a `key`-buffer containing all the hashes of the pads
used during encryption.


- `data` accepts Buffer, UInt8Array and Array

### `recover(key)`

Attempts to find all the pads referenced in the key and reconstruct the
original data.

returns a Promsie that resolves to your original data if
the key is valid.

If you're reading this it means that the docs are missing or in a bad state.

Writing and maintaining friendly and useful documentation takes
effort and time. In order to do faster releases
I will from now on provide documentation relational to project activity.
