# xorchive

> Hyperdimensional lockbox

A variant implementation of [OFFS technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OFFSystem).

No way to tell how many entries an archive contains.
Each pad in the archive might or might not be part of multiple files.

- Sits ontop of [random-access-storage](https://github.com/random-access-storage) (works in browser + node)
- [XOR-pad encrypts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_cipher) contents (default 7 pads)
- Unknown total amount of files
- Unique key for each file
- Uses blake3 to hash pads into keys

## <a name="install"></a> Install

```
yarn add xorchive
```

## <a name="usage"></a> Usage

```
const raf = require('random-access-file')
const Xorchive = require('xorchive')

const xfs = new Xorchive(raf('myStuff/'), nPads = 7)

let k1 = await xfs.store(readFileSync('~/secret_evidence.md'))
const k2 = await xfs.store(readFileSync('~/README.md'))
// Each key is (32 * nPads) bytes in size

const doc = await xfs.recover(k2)

let k1 = null // secret_evidence.md is now lost forever,
// and there's no proof of it ever having been stored.
```

If you're reading this it means that the docs are missing or in a bad state.

Writing and maintaining friendly and useful documentation takes
effort and time. In order to do faster releases
I will from now on provide documentation relational to project activity.
